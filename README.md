# Statement_of_purpose_LSTM


This project is a LSTM based custom text generator trained over 20's of Statement of purpose text file (10k words) to generate a sequence of meaningful text 

## Dependences : 
- Keras (tensorflow-gpu) <br>
- Numpy

# Cleaning data: 

python clean.py 

# Training 

python Training.py 

# Trained Model

I have attached a pretrained model, you can use the same to run your inference

sop_text_generator.h5


## Inference
Add your seed text line in the inference.py code
